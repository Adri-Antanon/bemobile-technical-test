This is a technical test in which I have to create a small mobile sales store


# Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


## `npm run lint`

It allows you to review the code and show you if there are any errors in it.
